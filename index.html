                <h3>My Journey As a Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    Every developer has a story to tell, and mine began in 2022 when I met Jeffrey Elkner at Monrovia
                    Consolidated School (MCSS) under the guidance of Mr. Isaac Saye-Lakpor Zawolo. Since my high school
